WHAT IS FF-STORAGE
------------------

ff-storage is a little php library that wraps around standard file
functions and provides a minimal API to read and write elements from/to a
plain text file.

Currently, ff-storage supports two different kinds of entities:

- strings: a set of characters with no particular pattern;
- objects: a set of attributes which are translated into a string of
  fields concatenated by a given delimiter.
